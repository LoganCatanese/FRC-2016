Evan's computer is no longer broken, however he is afraid to test EGit because he is scared his computer will fail him again. If you are brave please try EGit to ensure that Evan's issue was one with his computer and not the plugin itself. If EGit works, filesharing will become extremely efficient and life will be good.
